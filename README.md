## About the Project
Messenger App is a simple web-based chat application that allows users to participate in conversations by sending text messages and media files.

This project is designed with a modular architecture, separating the frontend and backend into independent services.
It focuses on delivering a functional, user-friendly, and scalable chat experience deployed in the cloud.

## Features
- üì® **Real-time Messaging** - Users can exchange text messages within conversations.
- üìÅ **Media File Uploads** - Support for sending and receiving media files via the chat interface.
- üîê **User Authentication** - Secure login and session management powered by AWS Cognito.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Modular Architecture** - Separation of concerns between the Angular frontend and FastAPI backend.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Deployment** - Full deployment on AWS infrastructure using Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3, and CloudWatch.
- üê≥ **Dockerized Services** - Both frontend and backend are containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform used for automating the provisioning of cloud infrastructure.
- üìä **Monitoring and Logging** - Application and infrastructure logs collected and monitored through AWS CloudWatch.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Media Storage** - Uploaded media files are securely stored in AWS S3 buckets.
- üß© **RESTful API** - Backend provides a clean and well-structured RESTful API for frontend communication.

## Architecture
- **Frontend** - Developed using **Angular**, the frontend delivers a responsive SPA that communicates with the backend via REST API. It also manages the OAuth2-based authentication flow with AWS Cognito.
- **Backend** - Powered by **FastAPI**, the backend handles user authentication, conversation management, message processing, and file uploads. It secures all API endpoints using JWT tokens issued by AWS Cognito.
- **Authentication** - User authentication and authorization are managed via **AWS Cognito**, providing secure, scalable identity management.
- **Database** - Persistent storage for users, conversations, and messages is provided by a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Amazon RDS**.
- **Media Storage** - Media files exchanged between users are securely stored in **AWS S3** buckets.
- **Deployment** - Both frontend and backend services are containerized using **Docker** and deployed independently on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** environments.
- **Infrastructure Management** - The entire AWS infrastructure (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, VPC) is provisioned and managed through **Terraform**, embracing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices.

| Part               | Technologies                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**       | Angular, Bootstrap, Docker                       |
| **Backend**        | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Docker              |
| **Authentication** | AWS Cognito                                      |
| **Database**       | PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS)                          |
| **Storage**        | AWS S3                                           |
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudWatch |

## Deployment
The deployment process for the Messenger App is fully automated using **Terraform**:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**  
   Terraform scripts located in the `config/terraform/` directory automate the creation of all necessary AWS resources.  
   Running `terraform apply` provisions the entire cloud environment, including VPC, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Cognito, and Elastic Beanstalk environments.

2. **Application Deployment**  
   Both the frontend and backend are containerized using Docker and deployed independently to AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments.

3. **Configuration Management**  
   Application environment variables, database connection strings, and AWS credentials are securely managed through Elastic Beanstalk environment settings.
